The answer lies with a special category of investment activity known as venture capital. Venture capitalists are professional investors who invest in a number of highly scalable high-risk technology ventures hoping to make a multi-fold"

While ride sharing in some form will probably survive, it\u2019s more likely that without some drastic changes, Uber won\u2019t be around in three to five years. Mr. Khosrowshahi must avoid the mistakes of his predecessor by accepting that \u201cpivots\u201d (Silicon Valley-speak for the desperate changes troubled companies make to reassure their venture capitalist funders) are not the answer.

Even Uber, with its massive $62-billion-plus valuation, will test investor's patience if it does not start showing signs of a profit in the next few years. Cracks are starting to show in terms of pre-IPO devaluations. Dropbox and Snapchat have seen a nearly one-quarter drop in their pre-IPO valuations, while Square's pre-IPO value has dropped by approximately one-third. Larger investors and venture capitalists are sending a message to the unicorns: Outline a solid path to profits and start producing them soon, or expect your valuation to be slashed. Diving ahead with an IPO is not"

    ],
    "output": "Firms like Snapchat and Uber are highly valued despite not generating profits for a long time because their success relies on innovative strategies, market demand, and potential for scalability. While venture capitalists typically aim to return investment through profits, these companies often prioritize growth over immediate returns due to the risks of overextending themselves or failing to capture market share. In the case of Uber, early pivots and attempts to address market challenges (like improving ride-sharing models) have led to losses. This highlights the difficulty of sustaining profitability without significant investment in innovation. Meanwhile, valuation success can occur even when revenue is stagnant, driven by long-term potential, brand recognition, or technological advancements. Venture capitalists may view these firms as undervalued or promising, encouraging further investment despite the risks of not seeing immediate profits."
